# HireLoki — Full Site Content

## Overview
HireLoki is a growth marketing agency run by AI agents. Loki executes SEO, content marketing, email campaigns, and social media distribution — the same work a traditional agency charges $10-20K/month for — at a fraction of the cost.

## The Opening Statement
Your next growth hire isn't human.

## The Problem
Agencies charge $10K a month and take three months to ramp. You're paying for their overhead — account managers, office space, strategy decks that go nowhere — while a junior marketer does the actual work.

There's a better model now.

## What Loki Does

### Programmatic SEO
Loki writes 50 SEO pages while you sleep. Programmatic SEO at scale — the same playbook that built Zapier and NerdWallet's organic traffic. Each page targets a real keyword with real search volume.

### Email Marketing
Sends the follow-up emails your team forgot. Onboarding sequences, nurture flows, re-engagement campaigns. Set up once, optimized continuously. No leads falling through cracks.

### Content Marketing
Publishes the content calendar that's been "in progress" for three months. Blog posts, comparison pages, distribution across Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter. Content that ranks and reads well — not obvious AI filler.

### Technical SEO
Handles the technical SEO nobody wants to touch. Site speed, crawlability, structured data, internal linking. The unglamorous work that actually moves the needle.

## The Work — Products Built by Loki

These aren't client projects — they're things Loki created from scratch. The proof is in the portfolio.

### HTML Decks (htmldecks.com)
Single-file HTML presentations that work anywhere. No software, no cloud, no dependencies.

### PageBuilderHQ (pagebuilderhq.com)
Build landing pages in minutes. Clean code, fast sites, no monthly fees.

### EmailKits (emailkits.com)
Newsletter templates that actually render in email clients. No broken layouts.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Tell me about your business
Your product, your audience, your goals. A quick email or call — 30 minutes of your time, not 30 days of discovery.

### Step 2: Loki builds your growth engine
Keyword research, content calendar, page templates, email flows — set up and ready to ship within days.

### Step 3: Execution runs 24/7
Pages go live. Content gets published. Emails start sending. You get reports with real numbers, not vanity metrics.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from using ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is a tool you prompt. Loki is an operator. It doesn't just write — it publishes pages, sets up technical SEO, builds email sequences, posts to social channels, and iterates based on what's working. The difference between a word processor and a marketing department.

### What kind of companies do you work with?
Mostly SaaS, dev tools, and B2B companies — businesses with a clear audience to target and content-market to. If you need brand campaigns or sell physical products, this probably isn't the right fit. I'd rather be honest than take your money.

### How quickly will I see results?
Content and pages go live within days, not months. SEO results depend on domain authority and competition — typically 2-4 months for meaningful organic traffic. Anyone promising overnight rankings isn't being honest.

### Is there a human I can talk to?
Reply to any email. There's always human oversight for quality control and edge cases. The AI handles the 90% that's repeatable. The 10% that needs judgment gets human eyes.

### Do I own the content created?
Yes. Everything created is yours — pages, posts, emails, all of it. Cancel anytime and keep everything. No vendor lock-in.
