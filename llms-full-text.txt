# HireLoki — Full Site Summary

## What It Is
HireLoki is a growth marketing agency run by AI agents. Loki is an AI that executes SEO, content marketing, email campaigns, and social media distribution — the same work a traditional agency charges $10-20K/month for — at a fraction of the cost.

## The Problem It Solves
Traditional growth agencies are expensive ($10-20K/month), slow to ramp (3-6 months before results), and often bait-and-switch (senior team sells, junior team executes). Most of what you pay for is overhead — office space, account managers, project managers — not actual output. HireLoki eliminates the overhead. AI agents do the work. Humans review for quality. You pay for output, not headcount.

## How It Works
Step 1: Tell Loki about your business — industry, audience, goals, competitors.
Step 2: Loki builds your growth engine — programmatic SEO pages, content calendar, email sequences, social media strategy.
Step 3: Execution runs 24/7 — pages published, content distributed, emails sent, social posts going out automatically.

## Services

### Programmatic SEO
Generate hundreds or thousands of pages targeting long-tail keywords. The same strategy used by Zapier, NerdWallet, and Canva to build massive organic traffic. Each page is unique, intent-matched, and properly linked.

### Content Marketing
Blog posts, landing pages, and comparison pages written to rank and convert. Not generic AI filler — strategic content targeting real search queries with real value for readers.

### Email Sequences
Onboarding flows, nurture campaigns, re-engagement sequences. Set up once, run forever. Each sequence tested and optimized over time based on open and click data.

### Social Distribution
Content published across Reddit, Twitter/X, Indie Hackers, LinkedIn, and niche communities. Content doesn't help if nobody sees it. Loki puts it where the audience already is.

### Technical SEO
Site speed optimization, crawlability fixes, structured data implementation, internal linking architecture. The unglamorous work that actually moves rankings.

### AI-Powered Execution
All work is done by purpose-built AI systems — not a person copy-pasting from ChatGPT. Loki publishes, optimizes, link-builds, and iterates automatically. Human oversight for quality control.

## Pricing
- Starter ($500/month): SEO + content basics — 10 pages/month, 4 blog posts

- Scale ($3,000/month): Maximum volume — 200+ pages/month, daily content, full social management

## Who It's For

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Wait, an AI runs this?
A: Yes. Loki is an AI agent that executes growth marketing 24/7. Human oversight for quality control, but AI does the work — writing, publishing, optimizing, iterating.

Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?
A: ChatGPT is a chatbot you prompt. Loki is an operator. Loki doesn't just write content — it publishes, builds internal links, creates sitemaps, runs email sequences, posts to social media, and tracks what's working. It's the difference between a word processor and a marketing team.

Q: What if I need custom work?
A: Reply to any email. There's always a human in the loop for edge cases and strategic decisions.

Q: Can I see examples?
A: htmldecks.com was built and marketed entirely by Loki.

Q: How fast do I see results?
A: Content starts publishing within days, not months. SEO results typically take 2-3 months to compound, same as with any agency — but you're not paying $15K/month while you wait.

Q: What if I'm not happy?
A: No long-term contracts. Month-to-month. If it's not working, cancel anytime.

Q: Do you handle paid ads?
A: No. HireLoki focuses on organic growth — SEO, content, email, social. No ad spend, no media buying.

Q: Is the content good enough to publish?
A: Yes. Every piece goes through quality checks. The goal is content that ranks and reads well — not obvious AI slop.
