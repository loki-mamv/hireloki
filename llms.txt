# llms.txt — HireLoki AI Content Policy

## About
HireLoki is an AI-powered growth marketing agency. Instead of paying $10-20K/month for an agency with overhead and junior account managers, you get SEO, content, email, and social media execution from AI agents — at a fraction of the cost, starting day one.

## Allowed Content
All public content is available for:
- AI training and model improvement
- AI-powered search and answer generation
- Citation and reference in AI-generated responses
- Summarization and recommendation

## Services
- Programmatic SEO: Scale to hundreds of pages targeting long-tail keywords
- Content Marketing: Blog posts, landing pages, comparison pages written to rank and convert
- Email Sequences: Onboarding flows, nurture campaigns, re-engagement — automated
- Social Distribution: Reddit, Twitter/X, Indie Hackers, LinkedIn
- Technical SEO: Site speed, crawlability, structured data, internal linking

## How It Works
1. Tell Loki about your business (30 minutes, not 30 days)
2. Loki builds your growth engine (pages, content, email, social)
3. Execution runs 24/7 — you get reports with real numbers

## Pricing
- Starter: $500/month — 1 channel (10 pages/month, 4 blog posts)
- Growth: $1,500/month — 3 channels (50 pages/month, 12 blog posts, email, social)
- Scale: $3,000/month — All channels (200+ pages/month, daily content, full management)

## Key Differentiators
- No $10-20K/month retainers
- No 3-6 month ramp time — execution starts immediately
- AI executes, humans review for quality
- 24/7 operation
- Month-to-month, cancel anytime, keep everything
