        <h1>Why Tampa Contractors Are Losing Jobs to Google (And 3 Things to Do About It)</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Your truck is lettered. Your work is solid. But when a homeowner in Carrollwood needs a roofer at 6 AM after a storm, they are not calling you. They are calling whoever Google shows them first.</p>

    <article>

        <p>It is 2 AM in Brandon. A homeowner's AC unit just died. It is July. The house is 89 degrees and climbing. Their kids are awake and miserable.</p>

        <p>What do they do? They grab their phone and type "AC repair near me" into Google.</p>

        <p>They do not flip through the Yellow Pages. They do not ask their neighbor (it is 2 AM). They do not scroll through Facebook. They Google it. And they call the first company that shows up with decent reviews and a phone number they can tap.</p>

        <p>If that is not you, you just lost a job. Not because your work is worse. Not because your prices are higher. Because the other guy showed up on Google and you did not.</p>

        <p>This is happening every single day across Tampa, Brandon, Carrollwood, New Tampa, Wesley Chapel, and everywhere in between. Roofers, plumbers, electricians, AC techs, landscapers -- good contractors with 10, 15, 20 years of experience are getting outworked online by companies that figured out three basic things.</p>

        <p>Here is what those three things are.</p>

        <h2>1. Claim and Complete Your Google Business Profile</h2>

        <p>This is the single most important thing you can do for your business online, and most Tampa contractors either have not done it or have done it halfway.</p>

        <p>Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is what shows up in the map pack -- that group of three businesses with the map that appears when someone searches "plumber near me" or "roof repair Tampa." That map pack gets clicked more than any other result on the page. If you are not in it, you are invisible.</p>

        <p>Here is the thing: Google does not just hand you a spot in the map pack. You have to earn it. And the bar is not that high -- most of your competitors have barely tried.</p>

        <h3>What to do right now</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Claim your profile</strong> if you have not already. Go to <a href="https://business.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business.google.com</a> and search for your business. If it exists but you have not claimed it, claim it. If it does not exist, create it. This takes 15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fill out every single field.</strong> Business name, address, phone, hours, service area, categories. Google ranks complete profiles higher than incomplete ones. Do not leave anything blank.</li>
            <li><strong>Pick the right categories.</strong> Your primary category matters the most. If you are a roofer, your primary should be "Roofing Contractor," not "General Contractor." If you do multiple things, add secondary categories. But get the primary one right.</li>
            <li><strong>Add your service areas.</strong> List every neighborhood and city you serve. Tampa, Brandon, Riverview, Carrollwood, New Tampa, Wesley Chapel, Lutz, Land O' Lakes -- all of them. When someone in Wesley Chapel searches for an electrician, Google looks at service areas to decide who to show.</li>
            <li><strong>Post photos of your actual work.</strong> Not stock photos. Real jobs you have completed. Before and after shots of a roof you replaced in Seminole Heights. A new panel you installed in Carrollwood. A bathroom remodel in New Tampa. Google likes photos. Customers trust photos. Post at least 10, then add more every month.</li>
            <li><strong>Post weekly updates.</strong> Google Business Profiles have a "Posts" feature that almost nobody uses. Post about a job you just finished. Post a seasonal tip ("Hurricane season is here -- 3 signs your roof needs attention"). It tells Google your business is active, and it gives potential customers more reasons to pick you.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>The cold truth:</strong> If you search "roofer in Brandon" right now and your business does not appear in the top 3 map results, you are losing jobs every week to contractors who do appear there. That is not a guess. That is how people hire contractors in 2026.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. Build a Real Website (Not a Facebook Page)</h2>

        <p>Here is something I hear from contractors all the time: "I have a Facebook page, that is my website."</p>

        <p>No, it is not.</p>

        <p>A Facebook page is not a Tampa contractor website. It is a social media profile on a platform you do not own, that you cannot control, that shows your competitors' ads to your own customers. Facebook decides who sees your posts. Facebook can change the rules whenever they want. And when someone Googles "electrician Tampa," Facebook pages rarely show up.</p>

        <p>You need a real website. Your own domain. Your own pages. Something that Google can find, crawl, and rank.</p>

        <p>This does not need to be complicated. In fact, the simpler the better. A Tampa contractor website needs five things:</p>

        <h3>The five pages that actually matter</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Home page</strong> -- Who you are, what you do, where you do it, and how to contact you. "Licensed roofer serving Tampa, Brandon, and Hillsborough County since 2011." Clear. Simple. Done.</li>
            <li><strong>Services page</strong> -- List every service you offer. Roof repair, roof replacement, commercial roofing, gutter installation, storm damage repair. Each service should have its own section or its own page. This is how you show up when someone searches "gutter installation Tampa" instead of just "roofer Tampa."</li>
            <li><strong>Service area pages</strong> -- This is the one most contractors miss, and it is a big deal for contractor SEO Tampa rankings. Create a page for each major area you serve. "Plumbing Services in Brandon." "AC Repair in Wesley Chapel." "Electrician in Carrollwood." These pages tell Google exactly where you work, and they help you show up in local searches for those specific areas.</li>
            <li><strong>About page</strong> -- Your story, your licenses, your insurance, how long you have been in business. People want to know they are hiring someone legit. A photo of you and your crew goes a long way.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact page</strong> -- Phone number, email, a simple form. Make it dead easy for someone to request an estimate. If they have to hunt for your phone number, they will call someone else.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Your phone number should be on every single page. Top of the page. Clickable on mobile. Someone should be able to land on any page of your site and call you within two seconds.</p>

        <h3>What about cost?</h3>

        <p>A good contractor website does not cost $10,000. It should not cost $5,000. If someone is quoting you those numbers for a basic contractor site, they are overcharging you. A clean, fast, professional Tampa contractor website can be built for a fraction of that, especially with modern tools.</p>

        <p>What matters is that it loads fast, looks professional on a phone (over 70% of your visitors will be on mobile), and has the right content for Google to understand what you do and where you do it.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>The test:</strong> Search Google for your trade plus your city. "Plumber Tampa." "Electrician Brandon." "Landscaper Wesley Chapel." If your website does not show up on the first page, you have a problem. And if you do not have a website at all, you are not even in the game.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Get Reviews and Respond to Every One</h2>

        <p>You know this already. You have probably told a happy customer, "Hey, leave me a review if you get a chance." And then they forget.</p>

        <p>Reviews are the tiebreaker. When a homeowner in New Tampa searches "AC repair near me" and sees three companies in the map pack, they are going to pick the one with 87 reviews and a 4.8 rating over the one with 6 reviews and a 4.5. Every time.</p>

        <p>Google also uses reviews as a ranking factor. More reviews (and better reviews) help push you higher in the map pack. So reviews do double duty -- they convince customers to call you, and they help you show up in the first place.</p>

        <h3>How to actually get reviews</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ask at the right time.</strong> The best time to ask is right after you finish a job and the customer is happy. Not a week later. Not in a follow-up email three days out. Right there, face to face, while they are looking at the clean work you just did.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it easy.</strong> Google lets you create a direct review link for your business. Get that link. Put it in a text message template. When you finish a job, send the customer a text that says: "Thanks for choosing us. If you have a minute, a Google review really helps: [link]." That is it. No long email. No complicated process.</li>
            <li><strong>Respond to every review.</strong> Good reviews, bad reviews, every single one. When you respond to a good review, it shows future customers you are engaged and appreciative. When you respond to a bad review professionally, it shows you care about making things right. Google also favors businesses that respond to reviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not fake reviews.</strong> Do not buy them. Do not have your cousin write five of them. Google's algorithm is good at spotting fake reviews, and if they catch you, they will remove them and tank your profile. Earn them the real way.</li>
            <li><strong>Set a goal.</strong> If you have fewer than 20 reviews right now, make it your mission to get to 50 in the next three months. If you are doing 3-4 jobs a week, that is completely realistic. You just have to ask.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Real numbers:</strong> A Tampa AC company with 150+ Google reviews and a 4.9 rating is getting calls all day long without spending a dollar on ads. A competitor down the road with better technicians but 12 reviews is wondering why the phone is quiet. The difference is not skill. It is visibility.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Matters More in Tampa Than Most Places</h2>

        <p>Tampa is one of the fastest-growing metros in the country. New construction in Wesley Chapel. Older homes in Seminole Heights and South Tampa needing constant maintenance. Storm damage across Hillsborough County every summer. The demand for contractors is massive.</p>

        <p>But so is the competition. Every month, new contractors are hanging their shingle in the Tampa Bay area. The ones who figure out Google early are going to lock in the leads and the reputation that keep them booked out for months. The ones who wait are going to keep relying on word of mouth and wondering why it is getting harder to fill the schedule.</p>

        <p>Word of mouth is great. It built your business. But it does not scale, and it does not work at 2 AM when someone's pipe bursts in Carrollwood.</p>

        <h2>You Do Not Have to Figure This Out Alone</h2>

        <p>If you are reading this thinking, "I know I need to do this, but I do not have time to mess with Google and websites while I am running jobs," that is fair. You are a contractor, not a marketing person. Your time is better spent on the truck than learning how Google's algorithm works.</p>

        <p>That is exactly why we built a service specifically for Tampa contractors and home service businesses. We handle the Google Business Profile, the website, the SEO, and the review strategy -- so you can focus on doing the work you are actually good at.</p>

        <p>No long contracts. No confusing reports full of numbers that do not mean anything. Just more leads, more estimates, more jobs.</p>

        <p>The contractors who are winning right now in Tampa are not necessarily the best at their trade. They are the ones who show up when someone searches. Three things -- Google Business Profile, a real website, reviews -- and you are ahead of 80% of your competition.</p>

        <p>The only question is whether you do it now or keep watching the other guy get the calls.</p>
